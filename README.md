# get_pass

**get_pass** is a very simple lib to get a password from a path using [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org).  
It is meant to be used where you don't want your password stored in configuration files for example. You put only the path of the pass file and get the password with this crate instead.  
**pass** need to be installed and configured on the system on runtime where the application using this library is used.
